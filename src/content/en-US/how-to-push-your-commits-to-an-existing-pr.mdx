## Understanding Git Workflow 🔄

Before we embark on our journey, let's quickly recap some essential Git commands:

### `git fetch`

This command fetches changes from a remote repository, enabling you to see what others have been up to without merging them into your own branches.

### `git log`

`git log` shows the commit logs, allowing you to review the history of commits in your repository. It's a great tool for understanding the evolution of your project.

### `git rebase`

`git rebase` is a powerful command used to reapply commits on top of another base tip. It's handy for keeping your commit history clean and linear, especially when collaborating with others.

Now that we have our tools sharpened, let's tackle the main task at hand!

## Pushing Commits to an Existing Pull Request 🛠️

Here's a step-by-step guide to seamlessly push your commits to an existing pull request:

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes:** Start by fetching the latest changes from the upstream repository using `git fetch`. This ensures you're working with the most up-to-date codebase.

2. **Check the Commit History:** Review the commit history with `git log` to understand recent changes and how your commits fit into the overall picture.

3. **Rebase Your Branch:** Execute `git rebase` to reapply your commits on top of the latest changes from the main branch. This action keeps your commit history clean and avoids unnecessary merge commits.

4. **Resolve any Conflicts:** If there are any conflicts during the rebase process, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. Take your time to address any conflicts and ensure a smooth rebase.

5. **Push Your Changes:** Finally, push your rebased commits to the remote repository using git push origin `<branch-name>`. This updates the existing pull request with your latest changes.

And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can effortlessly push your commits to an existing pull request and contribute to collaborative projects like a pro. 🌟
